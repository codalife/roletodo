The project is a ToDo App with 2 roles: manager and employee

To start:

1. Install yarn
2. run yarn to install dependencies

Stack:

1. React
2. Redux
3. Yarn + NPM
4. Webpack
5. Babel

Justification for choosing technologies:
Yarn - making sure application is not dependant on local machineâ€™s environment.
React - scalability, eaze of development and maintainance
Redux - not really justifiable for an app this size

Behind the scenes

1. Prettier on save
